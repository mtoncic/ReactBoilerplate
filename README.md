# React beginner's boilerplate

This boilerplate contains all you need to start creating react application using jsx and modern javascript features.
This is not supposed to be starter for bigger application, just as something used for react learning purpose.
Linting, testing and other common tools are not added to prevent beginners get overwhelmed.

```
webpack as module bundler that uses babel and html loaders
webpack-dev-server as dev server that provides live-reloading
htmlwebpackplugin that automatically generates entry html file using added template from the src/index.html and injects bundled javascript into
babel as transpiler [preset-env, preset-react]
npm as package management tool and for automation via scripts
react and react-dom npm packages
```

## Basic usage
**install application packages:** npm install

**build app -prod:** npm run build

**build app -dev & start app with live-reloading:** npm run start

Happy codding! :)
