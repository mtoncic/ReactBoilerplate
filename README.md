# React beginner's boilerplate

This boilerplate contains all you need to start creating react application using jsx and modern javascript features.
This is not supposed to be starter for bigger application, just as something used for react learning purpose.
Linting, testing and other common tools are not added to prevent beginners get overwhelmed.

```
webpack as module bundler that uses babel,css and style loaders
webpack-dev-server as dev server that builds app, runs it from the memory and provides live-reloading
css-loader that takes a CSS file and resolves imports and url() 
style-loader that takes styles loaded with css-loader and creates 
a <style> tag in page's <head> element containing those styles
babel as transpiler [preset-env, preset-react]
npm as package management tool and for automation via scripts
react and react-dom npm packages
```

## Basic usage
**install application packages:** npm install

**build app -prod:** npm run build

**start app with live-reloading:** npm run start

Happy codding! :)
