# React boilerplate

This boilerplate contains all you need to start creating react application using jsx.
```
webpack as module bundler that uses babel loader
webpack-dev-server as dev server that provides live-reloading
babel as transpiler [preset-env, preset-react]
npm as package management tool and for automation via scripts
react and react-dom npm packages
```

## Basic usage
